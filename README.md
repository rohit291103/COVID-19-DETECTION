    In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, this project leverages the power of Deep Learning (DL) to develop an accurate and efficient system for detecting COVID-19 from Chest X-ray images. The motivation behind this initiative is to provide a reliable and rapid diagnostic tool that aids healthcare professionals in identifying potential COVID-19 cases, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Key Features:

Deep Learning Model: The project employs a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on a diverse dataset of Chest X-ray images. The model is designed to distinguish COVID-19-related abnormalities from other respiratory conditions, contributing to high accuracy in detection.

Dataset: A carefully curated dataset comprising Chest X-ray images of confirmed COVID-19 cases, along with images of other respiratory diseases and normal cases, serves as the foundation for model training and validation. The dataset aims to encompass a wide range of variations to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.

User-Friendly Interface: The system includes a user-friendly interface that allows healthcare professionals to upload Chest X-ray images for analysis. The output provides information on the likelihood of COVID-19 presence, aiding in quick decision-making and patient management.

Interpretability: The project emphasizes model interpretability, providing insights into the regions of the X-ray images influencing the model's predictions. This transparency is crucial for building trust in the system and facilitating informed medical decisions.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to contribute to the global efforts in combating the COVID-19 pandemic by providing a reliable and accessible tool for the early detection of potential cases through Chest X-ray analysis. The integration of deep learning techniques enhances the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, supporting healthcare professionals in their critical decision-making process.

Technologies Used:

Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Python: Programming language for model development and implementation.
TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks for building and training deep learning models.
Flask: Web framework for creating the user interface.
Note: This project is a testament to the potential of deep learning in medical imaging and aims to make a positive impact on public health by providing an additional tool for the timely identification of COVID-19 cases.
